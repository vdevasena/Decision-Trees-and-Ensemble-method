# Decision-Trees-and-Ensemble-methods of Decision Trees

To avoid overfitting:<br>
1.Stopping the creation of tree early (pre-pruning)<br>
2.Building the tree but then removing or collapsing nodes that contain little information (also called post-pruning or just pruning).<br>


Ensemble methods: <br>
1. Random Forests <br>
2. Gradient boosted Regression Trees.
